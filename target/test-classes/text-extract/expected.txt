Daily AF Burden Duration and Number of AF Episodes
* Any AF episode continuing from prior day will be counted as a new episode for the day of the report. Durations of AF
episodes will be calculated from midnight to midnight, the day of the report.  Short episodes < 30 seconds may be missed
based on irregularity, artifact and/or length of event. If artifact occurs during an episode of AF, the episode will be counted as a
single continuous episode.

Daily Heart Rate AF Heart Rates/Onsets
* An episode of AF continuing from prior day will not be counted as a new onset. All new onsets are counted only if the
patient is no longer in AF and returns to AF. If artifact occurs during an episode of AF, the episode will be considered as a
continuous episode of AF.

Signature Date
AF Atrial Fibrillation: 1) Events lasting less than or equal to 10 minutes are graphed as 10 minute segments. 2) Atrial Fibrillation episodes are
detected with an algorithm that uses RR interval variability with P-wave detection and requires approximately 30 seconds to determine
periods of AF. It does not directly measure atrial activity. Atrial flutter or fibrillation that does not produce RR variability may not be
detected.
